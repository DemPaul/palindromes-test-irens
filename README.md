# Web-Calculator of closest palindromic numbers of inputted number
> Test task from Irens  

This application is based on algorithm of finding a certain amountr of closest palindromic numbers
by inputted number and number of palindromes to find.  
The performance of the algorithm for finding polyndromic numbers is demonstrated by appropriate tests. 

To launch the web application run the <b>irens.test.palindromes.jar</b> file and go to http://localhost:8080/ in the browser.
